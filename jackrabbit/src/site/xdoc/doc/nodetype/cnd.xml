            <p>
                The <strong>Compact Namespace and Node Type Definition (CND)</strong> notation provides a compact 
                standardized syntax for defining node types and making namespace declarations. 
                The notation is intended both for documentation and for programmatically registering 
                node types (if you are unfamiliar with JCR node types, you may want to read the 
                <a href="index.html">general Node Types section</a> first).
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is a "worst-case scenario" example that demonstrates all the features of the notation:
            </p>

// The namespace declaration
<ns = 'http://namespace.com/ns'>

// Node type name

// This node type supports orderable child nodes
orderable

// This is a mixin node type
mixin

// Nodes of this node type have a property called 'ex:property' of type STRING
- ex:property (string)

// The default values for this
// (multi-value) property are...
= 'default1', 'default2'

// This property is the primary item
primary

// and it is...
mandatory autocreated protected

// and multi-valued
multiple

// It has an on-parent-version setting of ...
version

// The constraint settings are...
< 'constraint1', 'constraint2'

// Nodes of this node type have a child node called ns:node which must be of
// at least the node types ns:reqType1 and ns:reqType2
+ ns:node (ns:reqType1, ns:reqType2)

// and the default primary node type of the child node is...

            A CND consists of zero or more blocks, each of which is either namespace declaration or 
            a node type definition. Namespace prefixes referenced in a node type definition block 
            must be declared in a preceding namespace declaration block.

prefix ::= string

uri ::= string]]></source>
            <p>
                A namespace declaration consists of prefix/URI pair. The prefix must be a valid JCR 
                namespace prefix, which is the same as a valid XML namespace prefix. The URI can in 
                fact be any string. Just as in XML, it need not actually be a URI, though adhering 
                to that convention is recommended.

            <p>
                A node type definition consists of a node type name followed by an optional supertypes 
                block, an optional options block and zero or more blocks, each either a property or 
                node definition.

        <subsection name="Node Type Name">
<source><![CDATA[node_type_name ::= "[" string "]"]]></source>
            <p>
                The node type name is delimited by square brackets and must be a valid JCR name. 
                It may be single-quoted (see Quoting, below). This element is the only strictly 
                required element within a node type definition, though a definition consisting 
                only of a node type name would simply define a new node type identical to 
                <code>nt:base</code>.

        <subsection name="Supertypes">
<source><![CDATA[supertypes ::= ">" string_list]]></source>
            <p>
                After the node type name comes the optional list of supertypes. If this element is 
                not present and the node type is not a mixin (see ?1.3.5 Options), then a supertype 
                of <code>nt:base</code> is assumed. If present, the element consists of a 
                greater-than sign followed by a comma delimited list of node type names, each of which 
                may optionally be single-quoted (see Quoting below). In Jackrabbit,
                multiple inheritance of node types is supported, so this list can be greater than
                one item in length.

            The option indicators follow the node type name and optional supertype list.

        <p>
            If the keyword orderable (or a short form) is present, then the orderable 
            child node setting of the node type is true. If the keyword is missing, 
            then the setting is false.

        <p>
            If the keyword mixin (or a short form) is present, then this is a mixin

<source><![CDATA[[x]>y,z orderable mixin -p(date)=a,b primary mandatory autocreated protected multiple version <c,d]]></source>
            <p>
                Additionally, though spaces are required around the keywords 
                (<code>orderable</code>, <code>mixin</code>, <code>date</code>, 
                <code>mandatory</code>, etc.), short forms for keywords can be
                 used. So, this:
            </p>
<source><![CDATA[[x]>y,z o m-p(date)=a,b ! m a p * version <c,d]]></source>
            <p>
                is well-formed (but perhaps not recommended!).
