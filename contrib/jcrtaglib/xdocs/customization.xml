			<p>
				The BeanFactory is responsible of the creation and
				lifecycle of beans. It can be a simple implementation or
				it can be a wrapper of an IoC framework such as
				Spring (included). <br/>
				Traverser, ItemFilter, ItemComparator and
				SizeCalculator instances are provided by this class
				based on the ID. The beanFactory is accessed through a
				JNDI address (see
				<a href="configuration.html#BeanFactory">
					configuration
				</a>
				).

		<section name="Traverser">
			<p>
				The Traverser is a visitor which walks through the tree
				and returns a Collection of nodes.
				<br />
				Included traversers are:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<b>PreorderTraverser</b>
					<br />
					Preorder traverse strategy
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>PostorderTraverser</b>
					<br />
					Postorder traverse strategy
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>LevelByLevelTraverser</b>
					<br />
					Level by level traverse strategy
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>AncestorsTraverser</b>
					<br />
					This implementation may be useful for displaying the
					breadcrumb.
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>ExpandedNodeTraverser</b>
					<br />
					This Traverser collects only the children of the
					ancestors in the path from the root node to the
					target node. It's useful for displaying a tree with
					only one node expanded.
					<br />
					In order to work the target node must be provided as
					a parameter (see traverserParam attribute in
					<a href="tag-reference.html#nodes">jcr:nodes</a>
					).
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>ExpandedNodesTraverser</b>
					<br />
					This Traverser collects the children of the
					ancestors in the path from the root node to any of
					the target nodes. It's useful for displaying a tree
					with many nodes expanded.
					<br />
					In order to work the target nodes must be provided
					as a parameter (see traverserParam attribute in
					<a href="tag-reference.html#nodes">jcr:nodes</a>
					), a jstl expression referencing a Collection or
					Iterator of Nodes.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</section>
		<section name="ItemFilter">
			<p>
				An ItemFilter implementation is responsible of
				evaluating whether the given javax.jcr.Item should be
				included based on the given expression (see filterExp
				attribute in
				<a href="tag-reference.html#nodes">jcr:nodes</a>
				).
				<br />
				A JEXLItemFilter implementation is provided. It
				evaluates any javax.jcr.Item based on a JEXL valid
				expression which returns a Boolean instance. The
				javax.jcr.Item to be evaluated is added to the
				JEXLContext under the key "item". A valid JEXL
				expression would be "item.name.equals('MyNodeName')".
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="ItemComparator">
			<p>
				An ItemComparator implementation is responsible of
				handling comparison of any javax.jcr.Item based on the
				given expression.
				<br />
				A JEXLItemComparator implementation is provided. It
				compares any javax.jcr.Item based on a JEXL valid
				expression which returns a comparable instance. The
				javax.jcr.Item is added to the JEXLContext with the name
				of "item". A valid JEXL expression would be "item.name".
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="TemplateEngine">
			<p>
				A TemplateEngine can be a simple template engine or can
				be a wrapper of a powerful template engine such as
				Velocity. It writes nodes and properties with the given
				template to the given writer.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section name="SizeCalculator">
			<p>
				A SizeCalculator implementation is responsible of
				calculating the size that uses a given Node or Property.
			</p>
		</section>
