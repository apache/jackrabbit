<!--
    The jcdAlias attribute is a shortcut name for the defined connection
    descriptor. OJB use jcdAlias as key for the defined connections.

    The default-connection attribute used to define if this connection
    should used as default connection with OJB. You could define only
    one connection as default connection. It is also possible to set
    the default connection at runtime using
    PersistenceBrokerFactory#setDefaultKey(...) method.
    If set 'true' you could use on PB-api a shortcut-method of the
    PersistenceBrokerFactory to lookup PersistenceBroker instances.

    The platform attribute is used to define the specific RDBMS
    Platform. This attribute corresponds to a
	org.apache.ojb.broker.platforms.PlatformXXXImpl class.

	The jdbc-level attribute is used to specify the Jdbc compliance
	level of the used Jdbc driver.

    The eager-release attribute was adopt to solve a problem occured when
    using OJB within JBoss (3.0 <= version < 3.2.2, seems to be fixed in jboss 3.2.2).
    Only use within JBoss.

    The batch-mode attribute allow to enable JDBC connection batch support
    (if supported by used database), 'true' value allows to enable per-session
    batch mode, whereas 'false' prohibits it.
    PB.serviceConnectionManager.setBatchMode(...) method can be used
    to switch on/off batch modus, if batch-mode was enabled. On PB.close()
    OJB switch off batch modus, thus you have to do '...setBatchMode(true)' on each
    obtained PB instance.

    The useAutoCommit attribute allow to set how OJB uses
    the autoCommit state of the used connections. The default mode
    was 1. When using mode 0 or 2 with the PB-api, you must use PB
    transaction demarcation.
    0 - OJB ignores the autoCommit setting of the connection and do not
        try to change it. This mode could be helpfully if the
        connection don't let you set the autoCommit state
        (e.g. using datasources from application server).
    1 - set autoCommit explicit 'true' when connection was created
        and temporary set to 'false' when necessary (default mode).
    2 - set autoCommit explicit 'false' when connection was created.

    If the ignoreAutoCommitExceptions attribute is set 'true', all
    exceptions caused by setting autocommit state, will be ignored.
    Default mode 'false'.

	If a jndi-datasource-name for JNDI based lookup of Jdbc
    connections is specified, the four attributes driver, protocol,
    subprotocol, dbalias used for Jdbc DriverManager based construction
    of Jdbc Connections must not be declared.

    The username and password attributes are used as credentials
    for obtaining a jdbc connections.
    If users don't want to keep this information the
    repository.xml file, they could pass user/password
    using PBKey.java to obtain a PersistenceBroker

    The object-cache element can be used to specify the ObjectCache
    implementation used by OJB. There are three levels of

        1. in OJB.properties file, to declare the standard (default)
        ObjectCache implementation.
        2. on jdbc-connection-descriptor level, to declare ObjectCache implementation
        on a per connection/user level
        3. on class-descriptor level, to declare ObjectCache implementation
        on a per class level

    The priority of the declared object-cache elements are:
    per class > per jdbc descriptor > standard

    E.g. if you declare ObjectCache 'cacheDef' as standard, set
    ObjectCache 'cacheA' in class-descriptor for class A and class B
    does not declare an object-cache element. Then OJB use cacheA as ObjectCache

<!ELEMENT connection-pool (documentation?)>


<!--
	maxActive
	maximum number of connections that can be borrowed from the

	maxIdle
	controls the maximum number of connections that can sit idle in the
	pool at any time. When non-positive, there is no limit

	maxWait
	max time block to get connection instance from pool, after that exception is thrown.
	When non-positive, block till last judgement

	whenExhaustedAction
	0 - fail when pool is exhausted
	1 - block when pool is exhausted
	2 - grow when pool is exhausted

	testOnBorrow
	The pool will attempt to validate each object before it is returned from the pool

	testOnReturn
	The pool will attempt to validate each object before it is returned to the pool

	testWhileIdle
	Indicates whether or not idle objects should be validated.
	Objects that fail to validate will be dropped from the pool

	timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis
	indicates how long the eviction thread should sleep before "runs" of examining
	idle objects. When non-positive, no eviction thread will be launched.

	minEvictableIdleTimeMillis
	specifies the minimum amount of time that a connection may sit idle
	in the pool before it is eligable for eviction due to idle time.
	When non-positive, no connection will be dropped from the pool due
	to idle time alone (depends on timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis > 0)

	numTestsPerEvictionRun
	The number of connections to examine during each run of the
	idle object evictor thread (if any)

    validationQuery
    Here you could specify a validation query used by pool to test a
    obtained connection (e.g. "select 1 from dual"), else a default query was
    used - if defined in the platform class for your database.

    logAbandoned
    Only supported when using
    org.apache.ojb.broker.accesslayer.ConnectionFactoryDBCPImpl
    ConnectionFactory implementation.
    Flag to log stack traces for application code which abandoned
    a Statement or Connection. Defaults to false. Logging of
    abandoned Statements and Connections adds overhead for
    every Connection open or new Statement because a
    stack trace has to be generated.

    removeAbandoned/removeAbandonedTimeout
    Only supported when using
    org.apache.ojb.broker.accesslayer.ConnectionFactoryDBCPImpl
    ConnectionFactory implementation.
    Flag to remove abandoned connections if they exceed the
    removeAbandonedTimeout. Set to true or false, default false.
    If set to true a connection is considered abandoned and
    eligible for removal if it has been idle longer than the
    removeAbandonedTimeout. Setting this to true can recover
    db connections from poorly written applications which
    fail to close a connection.

    of the connection).

	If the proxy attribute is set, proxies are used for all loading operations
	of instances of this class. If set to "dynamic", dynamic proxies are used.

	hold a unique number identifying the decriptors position in the sequence of
	field-descriptors.
	The order of the numbers for the field-descriptors must correspond to
	the order of columns in the mapped table.

	The name attribute holds the name of the persistent classes attribute.
	If the PersistentFieldDefaultImpl is used there must be an attribute
	in the persistent class with this name.
	If the PersistentFieldPropertyImpl is used there must be a JavaBeans
	compliant property of this name.

	The table attribute may specify a table different from the mapped
	table for the persistent class. (currently not implemented).

	The column attribute specifies the column the persistent classes field
	is mapped to.

	The optional jdbc-type attribute specifies the JDBC type of the column.
	If not specified OJB tries to identify the JDBC type by inspecting the
	Java attribute by reflection.

	The primarykey specifies if the column is a primary key column.

	The nullable attribute specifies if the column may contain null values.

	The indexed attribute specifies if there is an index on this column

	The autoincrement attribute specifies if the values for the persistent
	attribute are automatically generated by OJB.

    The sequence-name attribute can be used to state explicitly a sequence
    name used by the sequence manager implementations. Check the docs/javadocs
    of the used sequence manager implementation to get information if this
    is a mandatory attribute. OJB standard sequence manager implementations
    build a sequence name by its own, if the attribute was not set.

	The locking attribute is set to true if the persistent attribute is
	used for optimistic locking. can only be set for TIMESTAMP and INTEGER
	columns.

	The updatelock attribute is set to false if the persistent attribute is
	used for optimistic locking AND the dbms should update the lock column
    itself. The default is true which means that when locking is true then
    OJB will update the locking fields. Can only be set for TIMESTAMP and INTEGER
	columns.

	The default-fetch attribute specifies whether the persistent attribute
	belongs to the JDO default fetch group.

	The conversion attribute contains a fully qualified class name.
	This class must implement the interface
	org.apache.ojb.accesslayer.conversions.FieldConversion.
	A FieldConversion can be used to implement conversions between Java-

    Set this parameter to 0 if you want to turn this feature off.

	The refresh attribute can be set to true to force OJB to refresh
	object and collection references on instance loading.

	The auto-retrieve attribute specifies whether OJB automatically retrieves
	this attribute on loading the persistent object.
	If set to false the persistent attribute is set to null. In this case the
	user is responsible to fill the persistent attribute.

	The auto-update attribute specifies whether OJB automatically stores
	the referenced objects on storing the persistent object or not or only link.
	This attribute must be set to 'false' if using the OTM, ODMG or JDO layer.
    More info see OJB documentation.

	The auto-delete attribute specifies whether OJB automatically deletes
	the referenced objects on deleting the persistent object or not.
	This attribute must be set to false if using the OTM, ODMG or JDO layer.
    More info see OJB documentation.

	The otm-dependent attribute specifies whether the OTM layer automatically
    creates collection elements that were included into the collectionelements
    and deletes collection elements that were excluded from the collection.
    Also otm-dependent references behave as if auto-update and auto-delete
    were set to true, but the auto-update and auto-delete attributes themself
    must be always set to false for use with OTM layer.
