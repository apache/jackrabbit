The Apache Jackrabbit Project is responsible for creating open source
software related to the Content Repository for Java Technology API (JCR),
as specified through the Java Community Process in
<a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170">JSR 170</a> and
<a href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283">JSR 283</a>.
JCR specifies an API for application developers (and application frameworks)
to use for interaction with modern content repositories that provide content
services such as searching, versioning, transactions, etc.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.day.com/">Day Software</a>, the JCR specification lead,
licensed to the Apache Software Foundation the initial source code of the
JCR reference implementation for use as seed code for this project.
Development of the RI and TCK continues within this project, with participation
from the entire community in improving the implementation and refining the
test cases.

Our project is open to new contributors. To get involved, please subscribe
