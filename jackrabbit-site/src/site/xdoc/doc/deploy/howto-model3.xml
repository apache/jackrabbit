    <title>Model 3: The Repository Server HOWTO</title>
  </properties>
  <body>
    <section name="Model 3: The Repository Server HOWTO">
      <p>
        This document describes how to use a Jackrabbit content repository
        in the deployment model 3: The Repository Server. In this deployment
        model, a separate repository server is running outside the virtual
        machine the client application is running in. A repository server
        can serve multiple applications running on separate JVMs on separate
        network hosts. See the <a href="howto-client.html">JCR client
        application HOWTO</a> for instructions on how to use the configured
        content repository server.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that JCR specification defines no standard communication
        protocol for inter-JVM repository access, and that Jackrabbit
        supports no such protocol by default. However, Jackrabbit
        contains tools for using JCR content repositories over the RMI 
        and WebDAV protocols (see the <code>jcr-rmi</code> and the
        <code>jcr-server</code>, <code>webapp</code> packages).
      </p>
      <p>
        This how-to contains instructions for accessing a JCR-RMI server
        in <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">Tomcat</a>
        versions 4.x and 5.x. It should be easy to modify the instructions
        for other container environments and communication protocols.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to the following the instructions in this document,
        you also need to have an already running JCR-RMI server. See the
        JCR-RMI javadocs for instructions on how to setup such a server.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Warning:</strong> The current JCR-RMI library is designed
        for simplicity, not performance. You will probably experience major
        performance issues if you try running any non-trivial applications
        on top of JCR-RMI.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section name="Tomcat instructions">
      <p>
        Follow the steps below to setup a model 3 JCR-RMI client deployment
        for your web application in Tomcat 4.x or 5.x. Example code for
        both versions of Tomcat is included after this overview.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that these instructions closely follow the
        <a href="howto-model1.html">Model 1 HOWTO</a> instructions. By making
        similar changes (change the factory class and parameters of the
        repository) to the <a href="howto-model2.html">Model 2 HOWTO</a>
        instructions, you can setup a shared JCR-RMI client deployment for
        all applications in the container.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Place the JCR-RMI jar file and its dependencies (including the
          JCR API jar) under
          <code>[Tomcat folder]/webapps/[your app]/WEB-INF/lib</code>.
          You can find the jcr-rmi implementation under the contrib 
          folder of the Jackrabbit source distribution. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Register the JCR-RMI client repository factory in the context scope.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <subsection name="Step 2 - Context configuration">
        <p>
          In Tomcat 4.x and 5.0, add the following snippet in
          <code>server.xml</code> under the <code>Context</code> element
          of your web application.
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
<Resource name="jcr/repository"
          auth="Container"
          type="javax.jcr.Repository"/>

<ResourceParams name="jcr/repository">
  <parameter>
    <name>factory</name>
    <value>org.apache.jackrabbit.rmi.client.ClientRepositoryFactory</value>
  </parameter>
  <parameter>
    <name>url</name>
    <value>[The RMI URL of the repository]</value>
  </parameter>
</ResourceParams>
]]></source>
        <p>
          In Tomcat 5.5, add the following snippet in your application's
          <code>context.xml</code> file (or in the <code>server.xml</code>
          file if you prefer central configuration).
        </p>
        <source><![CDATA[
<Resource name="jcr/repository"
          auth="Container"
          type="javax.jcr.Repository"
          factory="org.apache.jackrabbit.rmi.client.ClientRepositoryFactory"
          url="[The RMI URL of the repository]"/>
