Jackrabbit JCR Tests

   This is the JCR Tests component of the Apache Jackrabbit project.
   This component contains a set of JCR API test cases designed for
   testing the compliance of an implementation. Note that although
   this code base is used also for the official JCR TCK, this is not
   the official TCK and passing the test of this component can not
   be used as an indication of API compliance.
