Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit Core -- Version 1.4.1

Introduction
------------

This is the 1.4.1 patch release of the jackrabbit-core component of
Apache Jackrabbit, a fully conforming implementation of the Content
Repository for Java Technology API (JCR).

This release fixes a binary property regression (JCR-1346) as well as other
issues reported against the Apache Jackrabbit 1.4 release. See below for
a full list of changes in this release.

See the Apache Jackrabbit website at http://jackrabbit.apache.org/ for

Release Contents
----------------

Unlike previous Jackrabbit releases that contained a full set of components,
this patch release only contains the jackrabbit-core component. The component
is distributed both as a source archive and a pre-compiled binary.

    * Source archive (jackrabbit-core-1.4.1-src.jar)

        The source archive contains the full source code of this release
        in a "jackrabbit-core-1.4.1" directory. Use the following commands
        (or the equivalent in your environment) to build the component
        with Maven 2 and Java 1.4 or higher:

          $ jar xf jackrabbit-core-1.4.1-src.jar
          $ cd jackrabbit-1.4.1
          $ mvn install

    * Pre-compiled binary (jackrabbit-core-1.4.1.jar)

        Core of the Apache Jackrabbit content repository implementation.

See the included README.txt file for more information.
