Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit -- Version 2.4.6

Introduction
------------

This is Apache Jackrabbit(TM) 2.4, a fully compliant implementation of the
Content Repository for Java(TM) Technology API, version 2.0 (JCR 2.0) as
specified in the Java Specification Request 283 (JSR 283).

Apache Jackrabbit 2.4.6 is patch release that contains fixes and
improvements over Jackrabbit 2.4.5. This release also contains a security fix
for Jackrabbit 2.4.4 and earlier. Jackrabbit 2.4.x releases are considered
