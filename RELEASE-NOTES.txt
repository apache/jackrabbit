Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit -- Version 1.5.1

Introduction
------------

Apache Jackrabbit is a fully conforming implementation of the Content
Repository for Java Technology API (JCR). A content repository is a
hierarchical content store with support for structured and unstructured
content, full text search, versioning, transactions, observation, and
more. See the Jackrabbit web site at http://jackrabbit.apache.org/ for
more information.

Apache Jackrabbit 1.5.1 is a security and bug fix release that fixes
issues reported against previous releases. This release is fully
compatible with the earlier 1.5.0 release.

Most notably, this release fixes the following security vulnerability.
Thanks to the Red Hat Security Response Team for reporting this issue.

  * CVE-2009-0026: Cross site scripting issues in webapp (JCR-1925)

    The search.jsp and swr.jsp pages in the Jackrabbit webapp are
    vulnerable to script injection. This release fixes the issue
    by properly escaping all user input.

    This issue affects both the Jackrabbit 1.4 and 1.5.0 releases.
    If you are unable to upgrade to 1.5.1 at this point, you can
    work around this issue by disabling the search.jsp and swr.jsp
    pages in the Jackrabbit webapp.

See below for a full listing of fixes included in this release.

Release Contents
----------------

This release consists of a single source archive (jackrabbit-1.5.1-src.jar)
that contains all the Apache Jackrabbit components. Use the following
commands (or the equivalent in your system) to build the release with
Maven 2 and Java 1.4 or higher:

    jar xf jackrabbit-1.5.1-src.jar
    cd jackrabbit-1.5.1-src
    mvn install

Note that the OCM components require Java 5 or higher, and are not included
in the build when using Java 1.4.

The source archive is accompanied by SHA1 and MD5 checksums and a PGP
signature that you can use to verify the authenticity of your download.
The public key used for the PGP signature can be found at
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/dist/KEYS.
