Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit -- Version 2.0-beta6

Introduction
------------

This is a beta release of Apache Jackrabbit 2.0. This release is a fully
compliant implementation of the JCR 2.0 API that was specified by the
Java Specification Request 283 (JSR 283, http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=283).
However, the beta status of this release means that some parts of the
implementation are not yet ready for normal production use.

Changes in this release
-----------------------

Jackrabbit 2.0 is a major upgrade from the earlier 1.x releases. The most
notable changes in this release are:

  * Upgrade to JCR 2.0. This Jackrabbit release implements and is based
    on the official JCR 2.0 API. All of the features required by the
    JSR 283 specification have been implemented. Note that the remote
    access layers (RMI and WebDAV) only support a subset of JCR 2.0.

  * Upgrade to Java 5. All of Jackrabbit (except the jcr-tests component)
    now requires Java 5 as the base platform. Java 1.4 environments are no
    longer supported.

  * Removal of deprecated classes and features. Jackrabbit 2.0 is not
    backwards compatible with client code that used any classes or features
    that had been deprecated during the 1.x release cycle.

  * Separate JCR Commons components. Many of the general-purpose JCR
    components like OCM are now developed and released separately from
    the Jackrabbit content repository. See the individual components
    for their most recent releases.

  * Database connection pooling is now available for all database backends.
    Non-pooled versions of the bundle persistence managers are still
    available in the org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.bundle package.
    To enable connection pooling in an existing Jackrabbit repository,
    replace the package name with org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.pool
    in your repository and workspace configuration files.

  * Data store feature enabled in the default repository configuration.

  * Full text indexing with Apache Tika. Jackrabbit can now extract and
    index the full text content of many new types of documents, including
    the Office Open XML files produced by Microsoft Office 2007 and higher.

  * Apache Commons Collections, Apache Derby, Jetty, SLF4J and Apache Xerces
    dependencies have been upgraded to more recent versions.

  * OracleFileSystem class does not use special blob handling anymore as it
    is not required for Oracle versions since 10R1. Use the Oracle9FileSystem
    class if you need support for Oracle 9 or earlier.

  * Modified support of XA transactions over RMI. Instead of implementing
    the org.apache.jackrabbit.api.XASession interface, JCR-RMI now makes the
    client session implement the javax.transaction.xa.XAResource interface
    directly whenever the server session does so.
