import javax.jcr.RepositoryException;

/**
 * This exception is thrown from a call to {@link HttpBinaryProvider#initiateHttpUpload(String, long, int)}
 * if no valid upload can be arranged with the arguments specified.  Some examples of
 * how this may occur include:
 *   - If the max upload size is not a positive value
 *   - If the number of URIs requested is zero
 *   - If the number of URIs requested exceeds the maximum allowable value for the
 *     service provider
 *
 * <p>
 * Additionally, the max upload size specified divided by the number of URIs requested
 * indicates the minimum size of each upload.  If that size exceeds the maximum upload
 * size supported by the service provider, this exception is thrown.
 *
 * <p>
 * Each service provider has specific limitations with regard to maximum upload sizes,
 * maximum overall binary sizes, numbers of URIs in multi-part uploads, etc. which
 * can lead to this exception being thrown.  You should consult the documentation for
 * your specific service provider for details.
 *
 * <p>
 * Beyond service provider limitations, the implementation may also choose to enforce
 * its own limitations and may throw this exception based on those limitations.
 * Configuration may also be used to set limitations so this exception may be thrown
 * when configuration parameters are exceeded.
