/**
 * Proxy for a repository bound in servlet context. The configured repository
 * attribute is looked up from the servlet context during each method call.
 * Thus the repository does not need to exist when this class is instantiated.
 * The repository can also be replaced with another repository during the
 * lifetime of an instance of this class.
 * <p>
 * A typical way to use this class would be:
 * <pre>
 * public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
 *
 *     private final Repository repository = new ServletRepository(this);
 *
 *     protected void doGet(
 *             HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
 *             throws ServletException, IOException {
 *          try {
 *              Session session = repository.login();
 *              try {
 *                  ...;
 *              } finally {
 *                  session.logout();
 *              }
 *          } catch (RepositoryException e) {
 *              throw new ServletException(e);
 *          }
 *      }
 *
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Starting with version 1.6 this class can also be used by a servlet filter:
 * <pre>
 * public class MyFilter implements Filter {
 *
 *     private Repository repository;
 *
 *     public void init(FilterConfig config) {
 *         repository = new ServletRepository(config);
 *     }
 *
 *     // ...
 *
 * }
 * </pre>
 
 *
 * @since 1.4
 * @see ServletRepositoryFactory
 * @see FilterRepositoryFactory
