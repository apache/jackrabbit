<!--
    the Repository element configures a repository instance; individual 
    workspaces of the repository are configured through separate configuration 
    files called workspace.xml which are located in a subfolder of the 
    workspaces root directory (see Workspaces element).

    it consists of

      - an optional Cluster element that is used for configuring a
        clustering node that synchronizes changes made in a cluster
       
      - a FileSystem element (the virtual file system
        used by the repository to persist global state such as
        registered namespaces, custom node types, etc.
        
      - an optional DataStore element to configure the component
        to use for storing large binary objects

      - a Security element that specifies the name of the app-entry
        in the JAAS config and the access manager

      - a Workspaces element that specifies the location of the 
        workspaces root directory, the name of the default workspace,
        the maximum idle time before a workspace is automatically
        shutdown (optional) and the workspace configuration root directory
        within the virtual repository file system (optional)

      - a Workspace element that is used as a workspace configuration
        template; it is used to create the initial workspace if there's
        no workspace yet and for creating additional workspaces through
        the API

      - a Versioning element that is used for configuring
        versioning-related settings

      - an optional SearchIndex element that is used for configuring Indexing-related
        settings on the /jcr:system tree.
