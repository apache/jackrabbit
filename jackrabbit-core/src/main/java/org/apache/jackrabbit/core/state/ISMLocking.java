/**
 * <code>ISMLocking</code> defines an interface for a locking strategy of an
 * {@link ItemStateManager}.
 * <p/>
 * An implementation of <code>ISMLocking</code> must meet the following
 * requirements:
 * <ul>
 * <li>While a read lock is held for a given item with id <code>I</code> an
 * implementation must ensure that no write lock is issued for a change log
 * that contains a reference to an item with id <code>I</code>.</li>
 * <li>While a write lock is held for a given change log <code>C</code> an
 * implementation must ensure that no read lock is issued for an item that is
 * contained in <code>C</code>, unless the current thread is the owner of the
 * write lock!</li>
 * <li>While a write lock is held for a given change log <code>C</code> an
 * implementation must ensure that no write lock is issued for a change log
 * <code>C'</code> that intersects with <code>C</code>. That is both change
 * logs contain a reference to the same item. Please note that an implementation
 * is free to block requests entirely for additional write lock while a write
 * lock is active. It is not a requirement to support concurrent write locks.
 * </li>
 * <li>While a write lock is held for a change log <code>C</code>, the holder
 * of the write lock (and any related threads) needs to be able to acquire
 * a read lock even if other writers are waiting for the lock. This behaviour
 * must continue also when the write lock has been downgraded.</li>
 * </ul>
