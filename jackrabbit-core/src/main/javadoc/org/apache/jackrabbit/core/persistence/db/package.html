<body>
This package contains the class <code>{@link SimpleDbPersistenceManager}</code>,
a simple generic JDBC-based <code>PersistenceManager</code> for Jackrabbit.
<p>
It also contains [schemaName].ddl files which are read by
<code>{@link SimpleDbPersistenceManager}</code>  in order to automatically
create the required schema objects on the target database. Every line in a
[schemaName].ddl file is executed separatly by calling
<code>java.sql.Statement.execute(String)</code> where every occurence of the
the string <code>"${schemaObjectPrefix}"</code> has been replaced with the
value of the property <code>schemaObjectPrefix</code> (see
 <code>{@link SimpleDbPersistenceManager#setSchemaObjectPrefix(String)}</code>).
The schema name is either set programmtically by calling
<code>{@link SimpleDbPersistenceManager#setSchema(String)}</code> or configured
through the <code>schema</code> bean property.
