<p>
A Jackrabbit repository instance can be created using the static
{@link org.apache.jackrabbit.core.RepositoryImpl#create(org.apache.jackrabbit.core.config.RepositoryConfig) RepositoryImpl.create(RepositoryConfig)}
method. Classes in the
{@link org.apache.jackrabbit.core.jndi org.apache.jackrabbit.core.jndi}
package provide a mechanism for binding a Jackrabbit repository in a
JNDI directory context.
<p>
A <code>SessionImpl</code> instance is created upon successfully login to the
<code>Repository</code> (see <code>Repository#login(Credentials, String)</code>).
<p>
A <code>Session</code> is always tied to the <code>Workspace</code>
specified in the <code>Repository#login(Credentials, String)</code> call. A
workspace represents a persistent tree of repository items (i.e. <code>Node</code>s
and <code>Property</code>s). The items in a workspace are 'visible' to all
sessions accessing it (subject to their access rights, of course).
A <code>WorkspaceImpl</code> instance represents a specifc workspace as
seen by the session that accesses it.
<p>
Every repository item is uniquely identified by its <code>ItemId</code>. The id
of a node (<code>NodeId</code>) consists of the node's uuid. The id of a property
(<code>PropertyId</code>) consists of the parent node's uuid and the
name of the property.

<h2>Item managers</h2>
<p>
Every <code>SessionImpl</code> instance has its own <code>ItemManager</code>.
The per-session instance of <code>ItemManager</code> acts as item factory (i.e.
it creates <code>NodeImpl</code> and <code>PropertyImpl</code> instances) and
provides item access by item id and item caching.
<p>
The data (or state) of an item is represented by the following classes in the
subpackage <code>state</code>:
<ul>
  <li>{@link org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.ItemState ItemState}</li>
  <li>{@link org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.PropertyState PropertyState}</li>
  <li>{@link org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.NodeState NodeState}</li>
</ul>
<p>
There's one <code>SharedItemStateManager</code> for every workspace.
It provides item state caching and it guarantees that there's only one
(persistent) item state instance for any distinct item id in that workspace.
<p>
Every session has its own <code>SessionItemStateManager</code> that consists
of the session's <code>TransientItemStateManager</code> and the workspace's
<code>SharedItemStateManager</code>.
<p>
Each item (i.e. <code>NodeImpl</code> and <code>PropertyImpl</code>) instance
is holding an <code>ItemState</code> instance. When e.g. a session is modifying
a property by changing the property's value, a new transient item state
is created by the session's <code>TransientItemStateManager</code>. This
transient state is actually wrapping the (old) shared state (<i>copy on write</i>).
The <code>PropertyImpl</code>'s state is then replaced by the new transient state.
<p>
Transient (i.e. unsaved) modifications are 'session-local',  i.e. they are not
visible to other sessions. When the modifications are saved they become instantly
visible to all sessions accessing the same workspace.
