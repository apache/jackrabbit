Jackrabbit configuration handling.
<p>
This package contains functionality for reading and manipulating the
Jackrabbit configuration. The configuration functionality can be
divided in two parts: parsing and representing configuration.

<h2>Parsing configuration</h2>
<p>
The configuration parsing functionality is located in the
{@link org.apache.jackrabbit.core.config.ConfigurationParser ConfigurationParser}
class. The parser class reads repository and workspace configuration
files and builds corresponding configuration object structures.
<p>
<p>
The static <code>create()</code> factory methods of the
{@link org.apache.jackrabbit.core.config.RepositoryConfig RepositoryConfig}
class are the standard ways of invoking the configuration parser.
</p>

<h2>Representating configuration</h2>
<p>
The parsed configuration information is represented using Config object
structures. The
{@link org.apache.jackrabbit.core.config.RepositoryConfig RepositoryConfig}
and
{@link org.apache.jackrabbit.core.config.WorkspaceConfig WorkspaceConfig}
classes are used for the top-level configuration. Other configuration classes
are used according to the class diagram shown below.

<p>
In addition to the static configuration information, some Config classes
contain references to configured implementation objects. These implementation
objects are not instantiated in the Config constructors to simplify
configuration parsing. Instead the Config classes provide an
<code>init()</code> method that instantiates and initializes all
contained implementation objects.
<p>
The
{@link org.apache.jackrabbit.core.config.RepositoryConfig RepositoryConfig}
class contains also a set of static and instance methods for manipulating
the repository configuration, especially creating and loading workspace
configurations.

<h2>Modifying configuration</h2>
<p>
The configuration classes in this package are immutable to enforce the
contract that the configuration should not be modified once it has been
intstantiated. It is possible to subclass the configuration classes as long
as the immutability contract is not broken. The public constructors allow
a limited form of dynamic configurability for Jackrabbit, but note that the
only officially supported Jackrabbit configuration interface are the XML
configuration files.
