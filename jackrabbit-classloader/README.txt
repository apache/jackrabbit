Welcome to Jackrabbit Repository Classloader
============================================

The Jackrabbit Repository Classloader component provides support for
loading Java classes from content repositories that implement the
Content Repository for Java Technology API (JCR). The component is
mostly independent of the underlying JCR implementation.

See the Apache Jackrabbit web site (http://jackrabbit.apache.org/)
for documentation and other information. You are welcome to join the
Jackrabbit mailing lists (http://jackrabbit.apache.org/mail-lists.html)
to discuss this component and to use the Jackrabbit issue tracker
(http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR) to report issues or request
new features.

Apache Jackrabbit is a project of the Apache Software Foundation
